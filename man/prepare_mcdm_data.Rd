\title{Prepare Data for Fuzzy MCDM}
\usage{
prepare_mcdm_data(data, syntax, alternative_col = NULL, aggr_fun = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing raw items.}

\item{syntax}{A string defining criteria (e.g., "Cost =~ c1 + c2").}

\item{alternative_col}{String. The name of the column identifying the Alternatives.
If NULL, rows are treated as distinct alternatives (single expert mode).}

\item{aggr_fun}{Function. How to aggregate experts (default: mean).}
}
\value{
A matrix ($m x 3n$) where m is the number of Alternatives.
}
\description{
Transforms raw survey data into a fuzzy decision matrix.
It calculates composite scores based on syntax, scales them to 1-9,
aggregates expert responses by Alternative, and then fuzzifies the results.
}
