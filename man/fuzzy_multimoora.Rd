\usage{
fuzzy_multimoora(
  decision_mat,
  criteria_types,
  weights,
  bwm_criteria,
  bwm_best,
  bwm_worst
)
}
\arguments{
\item{decision_mat}{Matrix (m x 3n). Alternatives (rows) x Fuzzy Criteria (cols).}

\item{criteria_types}{Character vector length n. "max" for benefit, "min" for cost.}

\item{weights}{(Optional) Numeric vector length 3n for fuzzy weights.}

\item{bwm_criteria}{(Optional) If weights are missing, BWM criteria names.}

\item{bwm_best}{(Optional) BWM best-to-others vector.}

\item{bwm_worst}{(Optional) BWM others-to-worst vector.}
}
\value{
An object of class `fuzzy_multimoora_res` containing rankings for all three sub-methods and the final consensus.
}
\description{
Implements the Fuzzy MULTIMOORA method (Balezentis et al., 2014).
It consists of three parts:
1. The Ratio System (RS)
2. The Reference Point (RP) approach
3. The Full Multiplicative Form (FMF)

The final ranking is derived by aggregating these three using the Theory of Dominance.
